Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosing liver diseases by visualizing the biliary tree. However, current analysis methods often rely on subjective interpretation and lack automated tools for quantifying complex structures. This code presents a novel approach by employing image processing techniques and fractal analysis to objectively analyze MRCP images. By dividing the image into a grid of cells and assessing contour simplification, the code identifies regions of interest indicative of disease pathology. It dynamically adjusts parameters to achieve optimal contour simplification, enhancing the accuracy of image analysis. Integration of such automated tools into hepatology can improve diagnostic procedures, offering faster and more precise assessments, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing biomedical technology in liver disease diagnosis.
